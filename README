# SEGMENTT

DISCLAIMER:
  This is not production code at all! This code is created by a graduate student at NTNU with deadlines and
  functionality in mind.

Project in IMT4126 - Fingerprint image segmentation (FIS):
  TASK:
    Implement one of the recent fingerprint segmentation methods for contactless fingerprint captures
  This python3 package is the implementation of the algorithm proposed and described by:
    G. Bailador, B. Ríos-Sánchez, R. Sánchez-Reillo, H. Ishikawa and C. Sánchez-Ávila, 
    "Flooding-based segmentation for contactless hand biometrics oriented to mobile devices," 
    in IET Biometrics, vol. 7, no. 5, pp. 431-438, 9 2018.
   
The algorithm is modified to detect the finger instead of its original purpose of detecting the hand. The package is
using OpenCV, which has a lot of optimized functionality for operation on images, and is used as much as possible to
increase the performance.

## INSTALLATION (*NIX):
    1. Make sure you have python3
    2. Create a new environment (Optional):
        $ python3 -m venv ./venv
        $ . ./venv/bin/activate # activate it
    3. Install the requirements:
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    4. Run the demo-programs:
        $ python3 ./src/demo_images.py

# MISC:
    The documentation for the algorithm can be found in the following file "./src/Segmentt/README"
    To use the algorithm, see the demo programs as well as the documentation above.
